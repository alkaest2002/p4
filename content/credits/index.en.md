The content of this site is inspired by the work of [David Keirsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Keirsey), an internationally renowned psychologist and creator of the [Keirsey Temperament Sorter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter). Keirsey's pioneering research on temperament has provided a new perspective on human behavior, refining and expanding on the [four temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments) postulated by ancient philosophers.

Keirsey's approach, outlined in his book [Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence (1998)](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL488149M/Please_understand_me_II), emphasizes how temperament influences personal preferences, relationships, and problem-solving styles.

The site offers users an overview of the author's theoretical formulations. The interpretations are adapted for a digital context to provide a practical, accessible guide aligned with modern times.
