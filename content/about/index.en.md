The content of this site is inspired by the work of [David Keirsey](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Keirsey), renowned psychologist and creator of the [Keirsey Temperament Sorter](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter). Keirsey's pioneering research on personality types has offered a fresh perspective on human behavior, refining and expanding upon the [four temperaments](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattro_temperamenti) initially proposed by ancient philosophers.

Keirsey's approach, outlined in his book [Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence (1998)](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL488149M/Please_understand_me_II), emphasizes how these temperaments impact personal preferences, relationships, and problem-solving styles.

The site offers users an overview of the theoretical formulations proposed by David Keirsey. The interpretations are adapted for a digital context to provide a practical and accessible guide.
